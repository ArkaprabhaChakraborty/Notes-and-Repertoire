# SNMP

## What is it?

Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP) is an [Internet Standard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet\_Standard) protocol for collecting and organizing information about managed devices on [IP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet\_Protocol) networks and for modifying that information to change device behaviour.

Three significant versions of SNMP have been developed and deployed. SNMPv1 is the original version of the protocol. More recent versions, SNMPv2c and SNMPv3, feature improvements in performance, flexibility and security.

**SNMP ports:**&#x20;

&#x20;\- **SNMPv3/v2/v1**: UDP **161, 162** (Trap)

&#x20;\- **Secure SNMP**: UDP **10161, 10162** (Trap)

SNMP is a routable protocol. Which means it can be easily accessed over the Internet as well if configurations aren't proper.
