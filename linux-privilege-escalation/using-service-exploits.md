# Using Service Exploits

Services are programs which run in the background, accepting inputs or doing regular tasks. If vulnerable services are running as root, we can exploit them to get command execution as root.

## Find services running as root

```bash
ps aux | grep "^root"
```

with any results identify the version n umber of the program being executed.

## Find versions with dpkg

```bash
dpkg -l | grep <package_name> 
```

## Find versions with rpm

```bash
rpm -qa | grep <package_name>
```
