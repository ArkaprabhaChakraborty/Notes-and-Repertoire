description: Exploiting vulnerable services

# Using Service Exploits

Services are programs which run in the background, accepting inputs or doing regular tasks. If vulnerable services are running as root, we can exploit them to get command execution as root.

## Find services running as root

```bash
ps aux | grep "^root"
```

with any results identify the version n umber of the program being executed.

## Find versions with dpkg

```bash
dpkg -l | grep <package_name> 
```

## Find versions with rpm

```bash
rpm -qa | grep <package_name>
```

## Finding service exploits

### searchsploit

```
searchsploit <package_name_and_version>
```

Google and web search

## Local port forwarding

Certain processes can be bound to a local/internal port through which it communicates. When an exploit for that particular service cannot be executed on the target machine, local port forwarding can be a go to method.

Using ssh a service running on a target machine's internal port can be forwarded to the attacker machine.

```
ssh -R <local-port>:127.0.0.1:<service-port> username@attackermachine
```
