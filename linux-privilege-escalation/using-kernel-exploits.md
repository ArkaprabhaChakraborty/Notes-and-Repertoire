# Using Kernel Exploits

## Some Info

### What is a Kernel?

A kernel is the core part of the OS which interacts with the hardware of a computer. Usually the flow of control is like the user "uses" an application software, which can make "calls" or "talks" with the shell. The shell in turn "talks" to the kernel.

### What are Kernel Exploits?

The kernel generally has full control of the system. Exploiting a critical kernel vulnerability can lead to root user privileges. This is what kernel exploits do, they exploit a kernel vulnerability in a crafty way to gain privilege access.

### How to find?

1. Find the kernel version.

```bash
uname -a
```

2. Google the kernel version and find CVEs and the exploit code (Linux is open source so mostly all exploit codes are open source).&#x20;
3. Compile and run. Most of them will be in C.

### Why you shouldn't use these?

These are highly unreliable and can brick the entire system. Generally in a pentest situation we do not want this to happen.
