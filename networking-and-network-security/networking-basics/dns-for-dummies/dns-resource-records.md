# DNS Resource Records

DNS uses a special database called a  DNS Zone database. Each such databases have a collection of "Resource Records" (also called RRs or zone files) to respond to "name resolution" queries from a user/client.&#x20;







Before DNS the name resolution was done using hosts file by the Operating System of the user/client.&#x20;

In fact the hosts file are still present to this date and the mechanism is still used. For unix/linux systems its the `/etc/hosts` whereas for windows its the `C:\Windows\System32\drivers\etc\hosts`
