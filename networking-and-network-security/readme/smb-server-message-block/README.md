# SMB (Server Message Block)

The Server Message Block protocol (SMB protocol) is common in enterprise networks where Windows services are running. It enables applications and users to transfer files to and from remote servers.

#### SMB runs on port 445.

Microsoft Windows operating systems since Windows 95 have included client and server SMB protocol support.&#x20;

Samba, an open source server that supports the SMB protocol, was released for Unix systems.

Apart from regular resource sharing, SMB is also useful for inter-process communication (IPC), such as in mailslots.
