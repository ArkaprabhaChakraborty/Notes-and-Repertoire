# SMB (Server Message Block)

The Server Message Block protocol (SMB protocol) is common in enterprise networks where Windows services are running. It enables applications and users to transfer files to and from remote servers.

The SMB protocol is known as a response-request protocol, meaning that it transmits multiple messages between the client and server to establish a connection. Clients connect to servers using TCP/IP (actually NetBIOS over TCP/IP as specified in RFC1001 and RFC1002), NetBEUI, or IPX/SPX.

#### SMB runs on port 445.

Microsoft Windows operating systems since Windows 95 have included client and server SMB protocol support.&#x20;

Samba, an open source server that supports the SMB protocol, was released for Unix systems.
