# BGP(Border Gateway Protocol) and AS Numbers (Autonomous System Numbers)

Traffic between Internet-based networks is controlled by using BGP and AS numbers. The IANA assigns AS numbers to RIRs, which in turn are allocated to ISPs and organizations so that they can manage their IP router networks and upstream connections.
