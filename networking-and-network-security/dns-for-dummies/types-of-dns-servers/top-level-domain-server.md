# Top Level Domain Server

A top-level domain (TLD) is one of the [domains](../../../#what-is-a-domain-name) at the highest level in the hierarchical [Domain Name System](../../../#so-what-is-a-dns), after the root domain.

The top-level domain names are installed in the root zone of the namespace. For all domains in lower levels, it is the last part of the domain name, the last non-empty label of a fully qualified domain name. For example, in the domain name www.example.com, the top-level domain is .com.&#x20;

Responsibility for the management of most top-level domains is delegated to specific organizations by the ICANN.

There are 5 official types of TLDs:

1. **Infrastructure Top-Level Domain (ARPA):** This special category contains only one TLD, the [Address and Routing Parameter Area (ARPA)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/.arpa). The .arpa domain extension is managed directly by the IANA for the [Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet\_Engineering\_Task\_Force) under the guidance of the Internet Architecture Board (IAB) and is only used for technical infrastructure purposes and [RFCs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Request\_for\_Comments) publications.
2. **Generic Top-level Domains (gTLD): These** are the most popular and familiar types of domain extensions. These have two subcategories:&#x20;
   * Top-level domains with three or more characters.&#x20;
   * Generic restricted top-level domains (grTLD) - managed under official ICANN accredited registrars.
3. **Sponsored Top-level Domains (sTLD):** These domains are proposed and sponsored by private agencies or organizations that establish and enforce rules restricting the eligibility to use the TLD.
4. **Country Code Top-level Domains (ccTLD):** Two-letter domains established for [countries](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Country) or [territories](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List\_of\_dependent\_territories). With some historical exceptions, the code for any territory is the same as its two-letter [ISO 3166](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO\_3166) code. There are 312 country code top-level domains established for specific countries and territories, identifying them with a two-letter string. These domain extensions have dedicated managers who ensure each ccTLD is operated according to local policies and meets the cultural, linguistic and legal standards of the region.
5.  **Test Top-Level Domains (tTLD):** These domains are reserved for documentation purposes and local testing, and cannot be installed into the root zone of the domain name system. According to the IETF, the reason for reserving these specific domain extensions is to reduce the possibility of conflict and confusion.

    There are four tTLDs:

    * **.example** - for place holding
    * **.invalid** - for invalid domain names
    * **.localhost** - for usage in local networks
    * **.test** - for testing purposes
