# Basics of SMB

The SMB protocol is known as a response-request protocol, meaning that it transmits multiple messages between the client and server to establish a connection.&#x20;

Clients connect to servers using TCP/IP (actually NetBIOS over TCP/IP as specified in RFC1001 and RFC1002), NetBEUI, or IPX/SPX.

For systems running SMB using NetBIOS, ports 137,138,139 along with port 445 should be open. Otherwise, if just port 445 it's just using SMB over TCP/IP directly.

### SMB Services

As a clientâ€“server protocol, SMB requires a **server service (**_**LanmanServer**_**)** and a **client service (**_**LanmanWorkstation**_**)**. Every Windows computer, whether it is running a server OS (like Server 2016 or Server 2019) or a client OS (like Windows 10 or Windows 11), has both the _LanmanServer_ and _LanmanWorkstation_ services.

To check for the status of the services we can use:

```powershell
Get-Service Lanman*
```
