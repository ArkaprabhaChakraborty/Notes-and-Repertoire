# Host Discovery

Host discovery is considered as the primary task in the network scanning process.  Host discovery provides an accurate status of the systems in the network, which enables an attacker to avoid scanning every port on every system in a list of IP addresses to identify whether the target host is up.&#x20;

## Using Hping

### ICMP Ping

Hping performs an ICMP ping scan by specifying the argument `-1` in the command line. You may use --ICMP or -1 as the argument in the command line.

```python
hping3 -1 10.0.0.25 
```

### ACK scan on a port

Hping can be configured to perform an ACK scan by specifying the argument -A in the command line.

```python
hping3 –A 10.0.0.25 –p 80
```

### UDP scan on a port

Using the argument `-2` in the command line specifies that Hping operates in the UDP mode. You may use either `--udp` or `-2` as the argument in the command line.

```python
hping3 -2 10.0.0.25 –p 80 
```

### Collecting Initial Sequence Number

Using the argument `-Q` in the command line, Hping collects all the TCP sequence numbers generated by the target host.&#x20;

```python
hping3 192.168.1.103 -Q -p 139
```

### Firewall Evasion with TCP timestamps

Many firewalls drop those TCP packets that do not have the TCP Timestamp option set. By adding the `--tcp-timestamp` argument in the command line, you can enable the TCP timestamp option in Hping and try to guess the timestamp update frequency and uptime of the target host.

```python
hping3 -S 72.14.207.99 -p 80 --tcp-timestamp
```

### SYN scan

The argument `-S` allows you to perform a SYN scan.

```python
hping3 –S 10.0.0.25 –V -p 80
```

### Scan over a range of ports

Using the argument `-8` or `--scan` in the command line, you are operating Hping in the scan mode to scan a range of ports on the target host.

```python
hping3 -8 50-60 –S 10.0.0.25 –V
```

### FIN, PSH and URG scan

By adding the arguments `–F`, `–P`, and `–U` in the command line, you are setting FIN, PUSH, and URG packets in the probe packets.

```python
hping3 –F –P –U 10.0.0.25 –p 80
```

### Scan entire subnet for live host

```python
hping3 -1 10.0.1.x --rand-dest –I eth0
```

By issuing this command, Hping performs an ICMP ping scan on the entire subnet 10.0.1.x; in other words, it sends an ICMP echo request randomly (`--rand-dest`) to all the hosts from 10.0.1.0 to 10.0.1.255 that are connected to the interface eth0.

### Intercept all traffic containing HTTP signature

The argument -9 will set the Hping to the listen mode. Hence, by issuing the command -9 HTTP, Hping starts listening on port 0 (of all the devices connected in the network to interface eth0), intercepts all the packets containing the HTTP signature, and dumps from the signature end to the packet's end.

```python
hping3 -9 HTTP –I eth0
```

### SYN flooding a victim

```python
hping3 -S 192.168.1.1 -a 192.168.1.254 -p 22 --flood 
```
