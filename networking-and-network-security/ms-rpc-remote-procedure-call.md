# MS-RPC (Remote Procedure Call)

Microsoft Remote Procedure Call (RPC) defines a powerful technology for creating distributed client/server programs. The RPC run-time stubs and libraries manage most of the processes relating to network protocols and communication. This enables developers to focus on the details of the application rather than the details of the network.

#### MS-RPC runs on port `135`
